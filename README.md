Hello! If you are reading this, you are reviewing and/or visiting my portfolio to see my work. This corresponds to the first iteration of my portfolio website. This project is being done to show my past and future work and as a first foray in the usage of Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind CSS beyond coursework.

In this iteration, it includes a basic layout and will be including further features as I go.
