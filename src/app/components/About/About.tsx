      <p>
        Since I was a child and inherited a 286, I&apos;ve been glued to
        computers. I majored in History back in college, but all my career has
        been leading to coding and web development. Today, I&apos;ve worked or
        developed from scratch more than a dozen websites for universities and
        other businesses and worked with people of all areas of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main ambition today is getting to build bigger and bolder projects.
        The world of coding and development is inmense and I&apos;m eager to be
        tested.

        I also like to take photos, play with my daughter and nowadays you can
        find me failing to input Shoryukens.
